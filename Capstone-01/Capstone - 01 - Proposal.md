### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
#### Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

### Background

###### Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

###### With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### Goals

People always looks for many features before buying their dreamed comfortable house, as it is a lifetime investment, by both Money and time. From the available dataset i would like to analyse to find out the following.

- What is the most features people are looking 

- Is there any corelation between the above features and the sale price

- Is it possible to predict sale price ?

#### Data Collection

The Ames Housing dataset (http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

###  Approach 

1. Understand the variables in the data

2. Clean data to exclude redundant entries

3. EDA

4. Construct models with various techniques

5. Find out the output

### Deliverables

1. Report/Paper

2. Jupyter Notebooks with data analysis

3. Model Accuracy Details
