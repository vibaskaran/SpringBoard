### TED Talks - Data about TED Talks on the TED.com website until September 21st, 2017
#### Visualize the Speakers based on the Chosen Topic

### Background

###### TED is a media organization which posts talks on line for free distribution, under the slogan "ideas worth spreading". TED was founded in February 1984 as a conference, which has been held annually since 1990.


### Goals

- Most popular Talks by category, views, comments, etc.
- Do certain videos get popular after certain events? (i.e: recession in â€˜08)
- Categories: education, tech, health, love
- Look at rating information to see what factors contribute to the success of a video

#### Data Collection

These datasets contain information about all audio-video recordings of TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017. The TED main dataset contains information about all talks including number of views, number of comments, descriptions, speakers and titles.
